# DPGAN
Created a Model that generate synthetic data from the real data and It will also predict future frame of a video  and help to get lost or encrypted data. Used PyTorch, TensorFlow and GAN models. 
Implemented differential privacy mechanisms, including Laplace noise and exponential mechanism, to 
ensure privacy of user, enabling secure data generation while mitigating risks of privacy.
